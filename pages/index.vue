        In the last two weeks we as Web Development students, at SAIT (Southern
        Institute of Technology), we have been exposed to several features of
        these three frameworks. With all the new libraries and frameworks it is
        pretty hard to keep up with all of them, and that is if you can even
        decide which ones are worth spending time one. VueJS is gaining
        continuous popularity lately and considered as one of the best
        JavaScript (JS ) framework. For developers who have experience Vue.js
        and also for those who want to change areas, there are many
        opportunities with **Vue.js, Tailwindcss and Nuxt.js.** To put it into
        context, we have to make it clear that this article is not about the
        perfect choice that will work for all cases without exception, even why
        this tool has yet to be created. We will be presented here a short
        overview about the ones of the most treding and robust solutions used
        for creating websites and that, for sure, can be the solution to some of
        your current pains.

      <blockquote>
        "Enjoyed learning Nuxt for the most part, I think because of the amount
        of time we had to learn it in class I’m still a little unsure of all the
        ins and outs. I enjoy doing Vue and working with components and the
        pages they load to. Tailwind seems interesting, I’m not sure if I enjoy
        using it but I guess we’ll see after this project! Maybe this site will
        look nice, maybe it’ll be a disgusting mess."

      <blockquote>
        "I enjoyed working with Nuxt and I can see how it could save me time,
        like doing multiple pages and then just simply calling them from the
        components. I enjoyed working with both v-for and mustache syntaxes, I
        did work with v-html/v-text but in future, I don't see any benefit of
        using v-html/v-text over the mustache? also, one thing I did not like
        about the v-for is that it's not as simple as the regular for loop just
        like in JS, don't get me wrong, it's easy once you do it and you get it
        to work but I still prefer the regular for loop."

       <cite class="text-2xl">~Mysia</cite>
      <blockquote>
        "What I've like most about this Vue was the usability of the components
        and how they work together. Tailwindcss it's seemed to be complicated at
        the first sight but it gets easier to use as it has a very long and easy
        documentation, but it will help you to save some time in large projects
        design.."
